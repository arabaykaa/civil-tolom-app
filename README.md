1. First, you need to delete the "/build" directory (to remove the old build files, as they won't work on a new PC).
2. Then, you need to run the command "flutter clean" (to delete the old dependencies).
3. After that, run the command "flutter build windows" and everything should be OK.

If something goes wrong, run the command "flutter doctor" to check for any issues
